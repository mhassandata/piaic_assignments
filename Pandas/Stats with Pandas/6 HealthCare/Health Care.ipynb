    "# Healthcare in Different States\n",
    "In this project, we will use boxplots to investigate the way hospitals in different states across the United States charge their patients for medical procedures.\n",

    "This dataset might look a bit familiar to you — we used it in our lesson about describing histograms. The data originally came from the United State Health and Human Services Department.\n",

    "We’ve imported the dataset into a variable named healthcare. Let’s take a look at what data we have to work with. Print healthcare.head(). This will print the first five rows of the dataset.\n",

    "Scroll through the table to see what information we have. We know that we want to eventually look at the way heathcare works in different states. What column will be useful to do that?\n",
